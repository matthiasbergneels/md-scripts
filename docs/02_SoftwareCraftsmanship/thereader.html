## An Epic Failure

----
> "We did not know it [the requirements]

----
> "... he [manager, PO, ...] wanted ... [it] done by a certain date

----
> "... we were almost certain we would not be able to deliver everything ...

----
> "... we told him [manager, PO, ...] that we probably would not meet the deadline ...

----
> "... if we worked hard we would be able to pull it off

----
> "... **we** said we would do it and try our best

----
> "... [they - management, PO, stakeholders] asked for more and more features but the deadline did not move

----
> “No, there is no negotiation, unfortunately. You need to implement everything,”

----
> "... we thought our only option was to get on with it and work as many hours as we could.

----
> "We spent a few weeks working long hours and weekends.

----
> "... just focus on building the business features because they had to demo them to the marketing team.

----
> "Guys, this is the last push and I know you can do it,”

----
> “Sure, we will do it.”

----
> "We would be considered heroes.

----
> "The system went live and in less than an hour, the application went down.

----
> "Who has time to write tests under such pressure?

----
## Lesson Learned

----
> "Well, we can say whatever we want, but saying anything after that epic failure was of no use.

----
> "We should have never said we would try to do something we already knew was impossible.

----
> "... we would still not have all the tests in place and all the confidence that the system would behave well.

----
> "Deep inside we wanted to show how good we were.

----
> "... we could be heroes.

----
> "... we should have never said we would try and never even thought about being heroes.

----
> "We should have made it very clear we would not commit to anything if ...

----
> "We did not act professionally by thinking we could be heroes.

## The Software Craftsmanship Attitude

> If we think that a piece of code we wrote some time in the past is still good enough today, it means we didn’t learn anything since.

----
> "Constantly finding ways to become better professionals is a lifetime commitment.

----
> "Who owns your career?

----
## Who owns your carrer?

----
> "These professionals need to invest in their own careers so they can do a good job...

----
> "Professionals are expected to provide solutions...

----
> "We should own our own careers and be in control of what we learn and when we learn.

----
> "So companies should not be investing in their own people?

----
> "So companies should not be investing in their own people?

## [NO, companies definitely should!]

----
> "Companies that provide time to developers to get better at what they do are much smarter and can become far more efficient.

----
> "Keeping up to date and constantly getting better at what you do is key for a successful career as a software craftsman.
